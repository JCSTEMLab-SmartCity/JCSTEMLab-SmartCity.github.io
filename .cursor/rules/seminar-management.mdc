# Seminar Data Management Guidelines

## Directory Structure and Organization

Seminar content is systematically organized in the `/data/seminar` directory using a date-based hierarchical structure for optimal chronological organization and easy retrieval.

### Naming Convention Standards
- **Format**: `YY-MM-DD-[SpeakerName]`
- **Examples**: 
  - `24-05-13-LiuJianqing` (Internal speaker)
  - `24-03-15-WeiHuaZhuang` (External speaker)
  - `23-11-22-RobertoRiggio` (International speaker)

### Directory Naming Best Practices
- Use **2-digit year** format (24, 25, etc.)
- **Zero-pad** single-digit months and days (05, not 5)
- **Speaker names** should be concatenated without spaces or special characters
- For speakers with common names, add institution identifier if needed
- Maintain consistent capitalization (PascalCase recommended)

## Required File Structure

Each seminar directory must contain the following essential files:

### Core Files (Required)
1. **`index.md`**: Primary seminar content with YAML front-matter and Markdown body
2. **`index.html`**: Generated or custom HTML version for web display
3. **`featured.jpg`**: Speaker photo or event image (recommended: 800x600px minimum)

### Optional Supporting Files
- **Presentation slides**: `slides.pdf`, `presentation.pptx`
- **Additional media**: Photos, videos, supplementary materials
- **Abstracts**: Extended abstracts or paper drafts
- **Resources**: Related papers, code repositories, datasets

## YAML Front-Matter Schema

The `index.md` file must follow this standardized structure:

```yaml
---
# Seminar title with date (required)
title: [Presentation Title] @YYYY.M.D

# Date in ISO format (required)
date: YYYY-MM-DD

# Optional fields for enhanced functionality
time: "HH:MM - HH:MM"  # Seminar time range
location: "Room Number, Building Name"  # Physical location
mode: "Hybrid"  # Options: "In-person", "Online", "Hybrid"
recording_available: true  # Boolean for recorded sessions

# Speaker information (recommended)
speaker:
  name: "Prof./Dr. [Full Name]"
  title: "[Position]"
  institution: "[University/Organization Name]"
  country: "[Country]"
  website: "[Speaker's Homepage URL]"
  email: "[Contact Email]"

# Categorization (optional)
tags:
  - "Research Area"
  - "Technology Domain"
  - "Seminar Series"

# Event type classification (optional)
event_type: "Research Seminar"  # Options: "Research Seminar", "Industry Talk", "Workshop", "Defense"
