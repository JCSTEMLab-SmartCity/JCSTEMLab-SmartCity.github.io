# Team Data Management Guidelines

## Directory Structure and Naming Conventions

Team member data is organized in the `/data/people` directory using a hierarchical categorization system:

### Category Prefixes
- **Faculty members**: `Faculty_[Name]` (e.g., `Faculty_ChenXianhao`)
- **PhD students**: `PhD[YY]_[Name]` (e.g., `PhD24_LiuLijie`, `PhD23_FangZhengru`)
- **Postdoctoral researchers**: `PD[YY]_[Name]` (e.g., `PD24_LiuZhaofeng`, `PD23_Caohangcheng`)
- **Visiting scholars**: `Visitor[YY]_[Name]` (e.g., `Visitor24_LiuYaxuan`, `Visitor23_JiYun`)
- **Former members**: `Former[Type]_[Name]` (e.g., `FormerPhD_ChenXianhao`, `FormerPD_WangJie`)

### Year-Based Numbering System
- Use 2-digit year format for categorization (23, 24, 25, etc.)
- Year typically represents the joining year or graduation year
- Maintain consistency within each category

## Required File Structure

Each team member directory must contain:

### Essential Files
1. **`_index.md`**: Main profile file with YAML front-matter and Markdown content
2. **`avatar.png`**: Profile photo (recommended: 400x400px minimum, square aspect ratio)

### Optional Files
- **`cv.pdf`**: Curriculum vitae
- **Publications folder**: Individual publication files
- **Additional media**: Research images, presentation slides

## YAML Front-Matter Schema

The `_index.md` file must follow this structure:

```yaml
---

## Biography Content Guidelines

After the YAML front-matter, include a biography section:

```markdown
# Biography

[Write a comprehensive biography in paragraph format]
- Use present tense for current positions
- Include educational background and career progression
- Mention key research achievements and awards
- Include collaboration information and lab affiliations
- End with contact information for prospective students/collaborators
```

### Biography Best Practices
- **Length**: 150-300 words for optimal readability
- **Tone**: Professional and academic
- **Structure**: Education → Career → Research → Current focus
- **Links**: Include relevant hyperlinks to institutions and collaborators
- **Updates**: Regular review and updates for accuracy

## Content Management Workflow

### Adding New Team Members

1. **Directory Creation**
   ```bash
   mkdir "/data/people/[Category][Year]_[Name]"
   ```

2. **File Setup**
   - Create `_index.md` with proper YAML front-matter
   - Add `avatar.png` (optimize for web: <500KB, square format)
   - Optional: Add CV and additional materials

3. **Content Population**
   - Fill out all required YAML fields
   - Write comprehensive biography
   - Verify all links and contact information
   - Ensure consistent formatting

### Updating Existing Members

1. **Status Changes**
   - PhD graduation: Move from `PhD[YY]_` to `FormerPhD_`
   - Postdoc completion: Move from `PD[YY]_` to `FormerPD_`
   - Faculty departure: Move from `Faculty_` to `FormerFaculty_`

2. **Information Updates**
   - Regular review of contact information
   - Update research interests and affiliations
   - Refresh biography content
   - Update profile photos as needed

3. **Archive Management**
   - Maintain Former_ categories for historical records
   - Preserve important achievements and contributions
   - Update status in user_groups classification

## Data Quality Standards

### Image Requirements
- **Format**: PNG preferred for avatar images
- **Size**: Minimum 400x400px, maximum 1000x1000px
- **Aspect Ratio**: Square (1:1) for consistency
- **File Size**: Optimize to <500KB for web performance
- **Background**: Professional, preferably solid background

### Content Standards
- **Accuracy**: Verify all institutional affiliations and contact information
- **Consistency**: Use standardized formatting across all profiles
- **Completeness**: Ensure all required fields are populated

### Technical Validation
- **YAML Syntax**: Validate front-matter structure
- **Link Verification**: Check all external links for accessibility
- **File Paths**: Ensure correct relative path references
- **Encoding**: Use UTF-8 encoding for all text files

## Integration with Website Systems

### Automatic Processing
- Team member data is automatically loaded by [js/team-loader.js](mdc:js/team-loader.js)
- Profile information populates the team section dynamically
- User group classifications determine display categorization
- Social media links generate contact buttons automatically

### Display Organization
- Faculty members appear first in team listings
- PhD students organized by year (most recent first)
- Postdocs and visitors listed by category
- Former members maintained in separate archive sections

### Search and Filtering
- Research interests enable keyword searching
- User groups allow category filtering
- Name fields support alphabetical sorting
- Institution data enables affiliation grouping

## Maintenance and Backup

### Regular Maintenance Tasks
- **Monthly**: Verify contact information accuracy
- **Quarterly**: Review and update research interests
- **Annually**: Complete profile review and photo updates
- **As needed**: Status changes and new member additions

### Backup Procedures
- Version control all changes through Git
- Maintain backup copies of profile images
- Document all directory moves and reorganizations
- Preserve historical data in Former_ categories

### Quality Assurance
- Peer review process for new member additions
- Standardized template compliance checking
- Regular link validation and testing
- Consistent naming convention enforcement
