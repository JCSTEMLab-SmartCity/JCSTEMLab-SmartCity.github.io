            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>The rapid development of high-speed railways (HSRs) has become a cornerstone of intelligent transportation systems. As HSR networks advance in speed, complexity, and scale, they impose increasingly stringent demands on next-generation communication systems—particularly in terms of reliability, latency, bandwidth, and security. This talk presents an in-depth analysis of the requirements for future intelligent HSR systems and examines how emerging 6G technologies can address these challenges. We begin with an overview of global HSR development and the growing demand for intelligent, safe, and autonomous operations. Key enabling technologies such as cross-domain channel modeling, advanced wireless coverage, ultra-reliable transmission, edge intelligence, and AI-driven security are discussed. These innovations in 6G help to significantly enhance the efficiency, safety, and intelligence of next-generation HSR networks, laying the groundwork for future high mobility infrastructure.</p>
